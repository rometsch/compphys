# Lab 2 of Numerical Methods lecture
All code is written in Python. Make sure to use Python version 3!

## Nonlinear Systems
Solution to Ex A1.

To find all roots of the the nonlinear system execute `find_all_roots.py`.

## Linear Systems
Solution to Ex B

Execute `matrices.py` to get the result of the matrix multiplication and the solution and test for the solution of the system of linear equations.
