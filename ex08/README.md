## Lorenz Attractor

This exercise is about integration of ODEs.

The ODE discussed in the problem set is integrated in `ode_solver.py`.
Methods being used are
  + Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4, globally 4th order)
  + Adams-Multon with Correction (globally 4th order)
  + Adams-Multon without Correction (globally 4th order)

Results of the error computed with the analytical solution are plotted against
the number of steps and the stepsize in
`error_h.pdf` and `error_N.pdf` which is generated by
`plot_error_h.plt` and `plot_error_N.plt` using Gnuplot.

The error is approximately proportional to h in this case for all methods.
Though it should be of order h^4 globally.

Adams-Multon method is independent of the use of the correction step here.
In principle the error should be smaller by a factor of about hundred.
Though its also proportional to the fifth derivative.

The plot `error_N_functioncalls.pdf` shows the error dependence on the number
of function calls (assuming an ideal implementation which this one here is not!).
Clearly Adams-Multon without the correction step is the most efficient here.
